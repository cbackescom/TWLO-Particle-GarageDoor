# TWLO-Particle-GarageDoor
Twilio &amp; Particle.io Powered Smart Garage Door

This example will enable you to turn your dumb garage door to a smart bot that you can ask questions.
Make sure if you use this code you protect your communications to/from Twilio by hardening the communication. Encryption and password protected URLs are a must for this type of project. Information captured on the open Internet that allow an attacker to obtain entry into your garage/home is dangerous. I have not inluceded a security code in addition to the security steps outlined below so use at your own risk!!

This example uses HTTPS URLs, password protected URL's and "From" checks to only allow approved phone numbers.
